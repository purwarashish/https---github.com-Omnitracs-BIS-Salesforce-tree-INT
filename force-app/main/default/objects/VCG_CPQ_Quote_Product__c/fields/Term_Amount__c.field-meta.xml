    <description>Amount to charge for first/current invoice term. For co-term&apos;d products, may be less than 12 months, otherwise first 12 months price. Extended amount, not per-unit amount. For Websense, since they charge the full contract amount up front, this is the full contract term amount. (I.e. First Invoice Term == Full Contract Term)</description>
